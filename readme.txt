To use server.py, run the python file with a port as an argument

- When first ran, the server will create a downloads directory called ServerDownloads, place any files you'd like users to be able to download there

- The server will also create a server.log file where you are able to view any logs that the server produces. - This does not get cleared when the server is reran
